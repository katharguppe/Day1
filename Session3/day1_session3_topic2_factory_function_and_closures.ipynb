    "## üè≠ Factory Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **factory function** is a design pattern where a function returns another function or object, often customized based on parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ What is a Factory Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **factory function**:\n",
    "- Takes input arguments.\n",
    "- Returns a new function or object.\n",
    "- Retains input arguments via **closure**, allowing it to behave like a template or \"function factory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Why Are They Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customization without Classes**  \n",
    "   Easily generate multiple variants of behavior without creating a new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**  \n",
    "   Keeps internal state private through closures, unlike public attributes in classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cleaner Decorators or Handlers**  \n",
    "   Factory functions are widely used in decorators, callbacks, and event-driven architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functional Programming Style**  \n",
    "   They align with the functional paradigm where functions are first-class citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† How Do Closures Help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures enable factory functions by **retaining references to variables** from the outer scope, even after that scope has exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the inner function to \"remember\" the configuration it was created with.\n",
